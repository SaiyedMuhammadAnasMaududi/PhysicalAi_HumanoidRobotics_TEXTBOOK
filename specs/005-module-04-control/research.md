# Research for Module 4: Control, Planning & Natural Interaction

## Key Findings

- **Control Theory**: PID control is a fundamental concept for robotic joint control and trajectory following. Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) might be relevant for more complex, dynamic tasks.
- **Task Planning**: Hierarchical task networks (HTN) and classical planning (STRIPS, PDDL) are common approaches for breaking down high-level goals into executable actions.
- **Behavior Trees**: A robust framework for robot control that combines state machines, sequences, and parallel behaviors, offering modularity and reactive capabilities. Increasingly popular in robotics and game AI.
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models**: Emerging large language models integrated with vision and action capabilities show promise for natural language instruction following and high-level robot reasoning. Examples include GPT-4 with robotics extensions.
- **Safety Constraints**: Essential for human-robot interaction and preventing damage. Includes collision avoidance algorithms (e.g., RRT*, sampling-based), joint limit enforcement, and fail-safe mechanisms.
