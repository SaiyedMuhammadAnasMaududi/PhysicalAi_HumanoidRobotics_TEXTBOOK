# Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2) Research

## ROS 2 Fundamentals

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is a flexible framework designed to make it easier and faster to develop robot software. It helps in dividing robot software into different sections called nodes, which communicate with each other through message passing. ROS 2 is recommended for both hobby projects and professional developments due to its enhanced security, support for different middlewares, and ability to run across various platforms and computers.

### Core Concepts:
Key fundamental concepts in ROS 2 include:
*   **Nodes:** Independent executable processes that perform specific tasks.
*   **Topics:** A bus over which nodes exchange messages.
*   **Messages:** Data structures used for communication between nodes.
*   **Services:** A request/response communication mechanism for synchronous calls.
*   **Parameters:** Dynamic configurations for nodes.
*   **Launch Files:** Used to start and configure multiple ROS 2 nodes and other processes simultaneously.
*   **Packages:** A way to organize your code and reuse it across different robots.

### Learning and Development in 2025:
For 2025, there are numerous resources available to learn ROS 2 fundamentals:
*   **Online Courses and Certifications:** Platforms like Class Central, Udemy, and Unstop offer various courses covering ROS 2 fundamentals, robot control, navigation systems, and advanced concepts using Python and C++. Some courses specifically mention "ROS Jazzy - 2025" and cover installation on Ubuntu 24.04.
*   **Workshops and Roadmaps:** Workshops are available that provide an introduction to ROS 2, its real-world applications (autonomous robots, drones, AGVs), and a step-by-step learning path from beginner to advanced levels.
*   **Practical Application:** Learning paths often involve hands-on projects, building real robots, and working with simulations.
*   **Simulation Tools:** For beginners, simulation tools like Gazebo and RViz2 are highly recommended to emulate real-world robot behavior. The TurtleBot3 is a popular choice for simulation.
*   **Key Tools:** Essential tools include those for recording messages (rosbag), debugging, and monitoring applications.

## Academic Sources

### Conferences and Specific Papers:

*   **IROS 2025** will feature research on ROS 2. One notable paper, "AS2FM: Enabling Statistical Model Checking of ROS 2 Systems for Robust Autonomy," by Henkel, Lampacrescia, Klauck, and Morelli, focuses on advancing rigorous and automated evaluation of robotic systems using formal verification, specifically Statistical Model Checking (SMC), for ROS 2 systems. Another paper at IROS 2025 will discuss a novel approach to using formal verification for autonomous robots, particularly concerning ROS 2 and Behavior Tree features.

### Key Research Areas and Publications:

*   **Formal Verification:** A significant area of research in 2025 involves the formal verification of ROS 2-based systems. An original research article published in July 2025, "A model-based approach to automation of formal verification of ROS 2-based systems" by Dust, Gu, Mubeen, Ekström, and Seceleanu, proposes a model-based methodology to automate the formal verification process using model-driven engineering techniques. This approach aims to make formal verification more accessible for robotics developers.
*   **ROS-Compatible Simulators:** A systematic review published in November 2025 evaluates ROS-compatible simulators for Industry 4.0 and 5.0. This study, which analyzed 65 peer-reviewed articles from 2021 to 2025, found that Gazebo is widely used in Industry 4.0 due to its ROS compatibility, while Unity is prevalent in Industry 5.0 for its advanced visualization and XR features. The research also examines the adoption of ROS and ROS 2 and identifies complementary communication and integration technologies.
*   **Teaching Aspects and Autonomous Vehicles:** Research from November 2024 highlights the increasing need for effective education in ROS 2, especially in the context of autonomous vehicles (AVs). This paper explores academic approaches and instructional methodologies for teaching ROS 2, emphasizing its modularity, real-time communication capabilities, and robust ecosystem for AV development. It details a curriculum with hands-on activities, simulation-based exercises, and project-driven modules.
*   **Comprehensive Review of ROS 2:** A systematic review titled "ROS 2 Key Challenges and Advances: A Survey of ROS 2 Research, Libraries, and Applications" was published in October 2024. This extensive review analyzes 431 ROS 2-specific publications from a database of nearly 7,500 ROS-related articles. It categorizes research into discussions of core concepts, proposed frameworks/tools, and applications utilizing ROS 2. The review also summarizes findings on ROS 2 challenges, advancements, and future directions in areas such as security, real-time performance, middleware, embedded and distributed systems, communication reliability, QoS, and multi-robot systems. It underscores ROS 2's enhancements in modularity, real-time capabilities, and security, while also identifying persistent challenges in scalability and reliability.
