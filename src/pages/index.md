# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook

Welcome to the **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics** educational textbook! This comprehensive resource will guide you through building autonomous voice-controlled humanoid robots from the ground up.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

This textbook is organized into **four core modules** plus a **capstone project**:

1. **Module 1: Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)** - Learn ROS 2 fundamentals, nodes, topics, services, URDF models, and Python integration
2. **Module 2: Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)** - Master physics simulation, digital twin setup, and sensor simulation
3. **Module 3: Perception** - Implement computer vision, speech recognition, and sensor fusion for environmental understanding
4. **Module 4: Control, Planning & Natural Interaction** - Build task planning systems, behavior trees, and safety-aware execution
5. **Capstone Project** - Integrate all modules to create a fully autonomous voice-controlled humanoid assistant

## 🚀 Learning Approach

- **Modular Design**: Each module is self-contained and can be studied independently
- **Hands-On Projects**: Every module includes mini-projects and practical exercises
- **Simulation-First**: All examples work in simulation (Gazebo) with optional hardware integration paths
- **Research-Based**: Content backed by academic research and industry best practices
- **Code Examples**: Tested Python and ROS 2 code examples you can run immediately

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)

## 🎓 Who This Is For

- **Students** learning robotics, AI, and autonomous systems
- **Educators** teaching Physical AI and robotics courses
- **Hobbyists** building personal robotics projects
- **Researchers** exploring humanoid robotics applications
- **Engineers** transitioning into robotics and autonomous systems

## 🛠️ What You'll Build

By the end of this textbook, you'll have built a **voice-controlled humanoid robot** that can:

- ✅ Listen to and understand voice commands
- ✅ Recognize objects and environmental cues visually
- ✅ Plan task execution steps intelligently
- ✅ Execute complex motions safely in simulation
- ✅ Handle ambiguous commands and edge cases
