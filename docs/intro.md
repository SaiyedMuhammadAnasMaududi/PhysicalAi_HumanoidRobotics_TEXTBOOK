  </div>
</div>

### Technology Stack

This textbook teaches you to work with cutting-edge robotics technologies:

- **ROS 2 (Robot Operating System)**: Industry-standard middleware for robot software
- **Gazebo**: High-fidelity physics simulation for safe testing
- **OpenCV**: Computer vision library for image processing
- **OpenAI Whisper**: State-of-the-art speech recognition
- **YOLO**: Real-time object detection
- **BehaviorTree.CPP**: Task planning and execution framework
- **MoveIt 2**: Motion planning for manipulation
- **Python & C++**: Primary programming languages

### Learning Philosophy

Our approach is built on three pillars:

1. **Learn by Building**: Theory is important, but nothing beats hands-on experience. You'll write code, debug issues, and see results immediately.

2. **Fail Fast, Learn Faster**: Simulation lets you experiment without consequences. Break things, try new approaches, and iterate quickly.

3. **Integration Over Isolation**: Real robotics requires integrating perception, planning, and control. Each module prepares you for the final integration project.

## 🚀 Learning Approach

- **Modular Design**: Each module is self-contained and can be studied independently
- **Hands-On Projects**: Every module includes mini-projects and practical exercises
- **Simulation-First**: All examples work in simulation (Gazebo) with optional hardware integration paths
- **Research-Based**: Content backed by academic research and industry best practices
- **Code Examples**: Tested Python and ROS 2 code examples you can run immediately

## 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, you should have:

- Basic programming knowledge (Python recommended)
- Familiarity with Linux command line
- Understanding of basic robotics concepts (helpful but not required)


## 🎓 Who This Is For

- **Students** learning robotics, AI, and autonomous systems
- **Educators** teaching Physical AI and robotics courses
- **Hobbyists** building personal robotics projects
- **Researchers** exploring humanoid robotics applications
- **Engineers** transitioning into robotics and autonomous systems

## 🛠️ What You'll Build

By the end of this textbook, you'll have built a **voice-controlled humanoid robot** that can:

- ✅ Listen to and understand voice commands
- ✅ Recognize objects and environmental cues visually
- ✅ Plan task execution steps intelligently
- ✅ Execute complex motions safely in simulation
- ✅ Handle ambiguous commands and edge cases

## 📖 How to Use This Textbook

1. **Sequential Learning**: Start with Module 1 and progress through each module in order
2. **Targeted Topics**: Jump directly to specific modules if you have prerequisite knowledge
3. **Project-Based**: Complete all mini-projects for hands-on experience
